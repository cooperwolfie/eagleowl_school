    <h1> Eagelowl News </h1>
    <p> A local hero came out of the crowd today at the Humane Animal Shelter Society of golf, where local resident Eagleowl Students Greenville, SC adopted 30 cats of various breeds and ages during a charity event. Adopting the cats was absolutely free, but taking care of the cats will be a major endeavour. A local bystander claims that Greenville, SC could not decide on which cat to take home, and eventually decided to just take them all. When asked what Greenville, SC planned to do with the feline friends, Eagleowl Students replied "they are going to help me with my rat problem!" </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6"> Our news team followed Greenville, SC to a nearby pet store where Greenville, SC bought "at least one thousand pounds of dry food and five hundred pounds of wet food," said Greenville, SC. Eagleowl Students, who admits to spending most of the day on Facebook, added "I am so happy to have all of these new friends. I've already got all of their names picked out. Teachers in the golf school district are under new pressures this week. Sen. Tom Jones has drafted a bill which proposes to limit school spending on a large scale, denying certain schools crucial funding. </div>
